FAQ:
====

So what is this pack?
---------------------

This Minecraft texture pack aims to turn all the villagers in Minecraft into [Will Smith][WillSmithWiki]... Just in a really terrible and awful way.

Why did you make this pack?
---------------------------

**TLDR:** I was bored

The full story behind this resource pack comes from a boring morning on a Minecraft server I play on, a friend of mine was working on some farms and mentioned something about the villagers used in it, during this they had mispelled "villagers" as "willagers" which I made a joke about Villagers all being [Will Smith][WillSmithWiki] and their sounds being random things in his voice. I then decided because I had nothing better to do to persue this god awful idea and make this pack.

What versions does this support?
--------------------------------

The pack was made for **1.19** but should work in 1.18 and some versions below, if I get time I will maybe test older versions and maybe create ports for non working ones.

You **are** aware someone has most likely made a pack like this before right?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yeah... don't really care though, this is my version of it! :D
